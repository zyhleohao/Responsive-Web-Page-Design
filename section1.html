        Risk Assessment and Hazard Mapping
        <br>
        <br>
        The first step to managing a natural disaster is the assessment of risks that are likely to be faced. Geographic Information System (GIS) forms hazard maps by compiling data from different sources including topography, land use, population distribution and historical disaster records; hence it plays a significant role in this field. The maps aid in pinpointing high-risk areas and demographics, enabling the concerned authorities to come up with specific preemptive measures as well as strategies for reducing the impact of disasters. For example, flood risk models based on GIS can estimate probable zones that would be water logged under varying situations which in turn helps in guiding decisions related to urban planning and infrastructure development.
