        Post-disaster Recovery and Resilience Building
        <br>
        <br>
        When disaster strikes, GIS comes into play in assessing the damages and planning on how to recover from them. An interesting approach to take while quantifying effects of disasters on the various aspects such as infrastructure, housing and natural resources is through carrying out a spatial analysis using pre- and post-disaster imageries. This guides the resource allocation prioritization thus influencing the reconstruction programs that are put in place later. Additionally, GIS fosters long-term resilience building by allowing for a comprehensive disaster management plan to be developed based on an analysis of past events and future projections â€” which then informs appropriate design of resilient infrastructure plus implementation of good land-use policies aimed at reducing vulnerability to future disasters.
