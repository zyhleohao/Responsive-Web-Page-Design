        Following a disaster, GIS is used to identify the extent of damage and plan for recovery. The spatial analysis of pre- and post-disaster images helps to quantify impacts on infrastructure, housing and even environmental resources which in turn help inform efforts during reconstruction and resource allocation where such data leads at prioritizing them. Additionally, as a tool for establishing comprehensive disaster management frameworks, GIS contributes to enhancing resilience in the long term. Through historical event analysis juxtaposed with future projections at community level use of GIS aids in coming up with an infrastructure resilient design — based on prudent land-use policies developed to low vulnerability — towards future disasters that can be implemented to ensure a reduced impact on future disasters.
